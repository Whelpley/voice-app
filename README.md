#Web-Audio-Sandbox

A Web Audio API-powered voice changer and visualizer, in development.

Launching off from the [Voice-Change-O-Matic](https://github.com/mdn/voice-change-o-matic) example; taking it into space.

##Project objectives:

### Short-term

* Get original app into working state. (The Voice-Change-O-Matic does not return the changed microphone input as promised)
* Convert to an Angular app
* Capture and save recordings from microphone 

### Stretch Goals

* Add additional sound distortion features
* Allow users to create profiles and share sounds with other users
